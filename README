This file repository contains matlab code needed to solve for the soliton solution of the perturbed 3D cubic NLS for various potentials V;
count the number of eigenstates of the perturbed 3D cubic NLS with that V; and graph the zeros of the resulting plucker system. 
The code is highly modular, which helps with testing and comparing a very wide variety of potentials. The code makes extensive use of Boundary Value Problem 
solvers and Initial Value Problem solvers in the matlab libraries. All of the code runs when called from the main.m file. 
Code used in my math PhD dissertation at UNC Chapel Hill.
